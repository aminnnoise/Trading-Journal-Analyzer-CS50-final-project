# Trading-Journal-Analyzer-CS50-final-project
This project is a Python-based trading journal analyzer designed as the final project for CS50P. It retrieves futures trading history from the Bitunix API, stores it in a CSV file, analyzes key performance metrics, and presents both textual summaries and visual charts.
